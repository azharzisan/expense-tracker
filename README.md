## 🚀 About This Project

This is my **first production-ready web application** — a personal expense tracker that helps you log, categorize, and visualize your spending. I built this to practice real-world React patterns and ship something I actually use every day.

It's not backed by a database (yet!) — data lives in your browser's `localStorage`, which means it's fast, private, and works offline. A proper backend with persistent storage is planned for a future release.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Visual Charts** — Doughnut chart to see expense breakdown by type; Line chart for spending trends over time
- 🗂️ **Expense Categories** — Create custom expense types (Food, Rent, Transport, etc.) and assign them per entry
- 📅 **Date-Based Filtering** — Filter your expenses by **Today**, **This Week**, or **This Month**
- 📋 **Table View** — Clean tabular overview of all your logged expenses
- 🔍 **Search by Date** — Look up expenses for any specific date
- 💾 **LocalStorage Persistence** — Data stays between sessions without a database
- 🧹 **Cache Clear** — One-click button to wipe all stored data and start fresh
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Works across desktop and mobile
